# 'int'

int(x, base=10) .It is a python class, which creates an instance of integer.it returns an integer object constructed from a number or string x, or return 0 if no arguments are given.

# 'encoded_from_base10'

This is function defined to convert any base 10 number to a different base defined by the user.The function accepts the number which is to be converted, the target base to which the number should be converted and the digit_map for defining the characters for the base. The function is only supposed to convert to any base ranging from 2 to 36 and throw proper ValueError otherwise. it also checks for the length of the digit_map and raises a ValueError if it is not sufficient for the base or there are repeating characters in the map.

# 'digit_map'

Digit_map is the mapping used for generating the final encoding in the target base.length of digit_map should be greater than or equal to base value and should not have repeating characters.

# 'ValueError'

Python provides a built in way to raise exceptions if there are any value errors i.e. user can raise this exception if the value does not match the expected range or anything else that a user want to enforce.

# 'math'

math is a module that provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.

# 'isclose'

math.isclose() method is used to determine whether two floating point numbers are close in value. Syntax: isclose(a, b, rel_tol = 0.00005, abs_tol 0.0) Parameters: rel_tol: maximum difference for being considered "close", relative to the magnitude of the input values abs_tol: maximum difference for being considered "close", regardless of the magnitude of the input values rel_tol and abs_tol can be changed by using keyword argument, or by simply providing directly as according to their positions in the parameter list. Return Value : Return True if a is close in value to b, and False otherwise.

# 'absolute' 'tolerance'

maximum difference for being considered "close", regardless of the magnitude of the input values.

# 'relative' 'tolerance'

maximum difference for being considered "close", relative to the magnitude of the input values.

# 'bin('

bin() is an in-built function in Python that takes in integer x and returns the binary representation of x in a string format.

# 'hex('

hex() function is one of the built-in functions in Python3, which is used to convert an integer number into itâ€™s corresponding hexadecimal form.Convert an integer number to a lowercase hexadecimal string prefixed with 0x

# 'round'

The round() function returns a floating point number that is a rounded version of the specified number, with the specified number of decimals.

# 'truncation'

The truncation function truncates the number and returns only the integer part.

# 'error'

a measure of the estimated difference between the observed or calculated value of a quantity and its true value.

# 'equality'

float equality test function checks if the 2 numbers passed are close to each other or not.Both relative as well as absolute tolerance to determine that.

# 'zero'

Zero is the integer denoted 0 that, when used as a counting number, means that no objects are present. It is the only integer (and, in fact, the only real number) that is neither negative nor positive

# 'away'

to or at a distance from a particular place, person, or thing :)
